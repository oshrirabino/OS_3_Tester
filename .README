🧪 ex3 Tester

This is an automated testing script for ex3, a C project with two main modes: Focus-Mode and CPU-Scheduler.
The script compiles the code, runs multiple test cases, compares the output to expected results, and reports the outcome.
# note all c files you should provide by yourself

🛠️ How to Run:

chmod +x tester.sh
./tester.sh

✅ What It Does

    Compiles ex3.c using gcc -o ex3 ex3.c

    Runs:

        ./ex3 Focus-Mode 3 4 < test1/input.txt > test1/output.txt

        ./ex3 CPU-Scheduler test2/input/processes{i}.csv <time_quantum>

    Compares each output with the corresponding expected output

    Logs errors (if any) in the logs/ directory

    If all tests pass, it:

        Deletes logs/

        Deletes test2/user/

        Deletes test1/output.txt

📝 Notes

    All test input/output files are pre-prepared.

    Logs are only kept if tests fail for debugging purposes.

    If your code works fine on the shell but the output is full of duplicates with the tester check if you used printf() function instead write().
    That can cause output issues when used ">" flag in Bash.

🐧 Requirements

    Bash shell

    GCC compiler

    Standard Unix tools: diff, mkdir, rm, etc.
