🧪 ex3 Tester

This is an automated testing script for ex3, a C project with two main modes: Focus-Mode and CPU-Scheduler. The script compiles the code, runs multiple test cases, compares the output to expected results, and reports the outcome.

🛠️ How to Run

chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh

✅ What It Does

    Compiles ex3.c using gcc -o ex3 ex3.c

    Runs:

        ./ex3 Focus-Mode 3 4 < test1/input.txt > test1/output.txt

        ./ex3 CPU-Scheduler test2/input/processes{i}.csv <time_quantum>

    Compares each output with the corresponding expected output

    Logs errors (if any) in the logs/ directory

    If all tests pass, it:

        Deletes logs/

        Deletes test2/user/

        Deletes test1/output.txt

        Shows a friendly “All tests passed” message with cute ASCII art 🎉

📝 Notes

    All test input/output files are pre-prepared.

    You only need to provide a working ex3.c file — the script takes care of the rest.

    Logs are only kept if tests fail for debugging purposes.

🐧 Requirements

    Bash shell

    GCC compiler

    Standard Unix tools: diff, mkdir, rm, etc.
